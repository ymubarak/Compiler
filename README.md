# Compiler
Given lexical rules and a language;s grammar, this program generates a lexical analyzer and a parser that accept and parse the input program according to the language specifications. 

The case study language in this project is a simplified version of java. The output of the generators is a "compiler", and the output of the resulting compiler given an input program is "java bytecode".
